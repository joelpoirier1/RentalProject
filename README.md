This project is a property rental application with the following specs:

RQ1: Landlords should be able to register their properties using this online application. Once their property
is registered they should be able to pay certain fee and make their property posted online and be available ro
renters to view it. The fee is certain amount in dollars for a fixed period of time (example 60 days).
• RQ2: Regular renters don't need to login, and should be able to enter their search criteria such as:
o Apartment, attached/detached house, townhouse, etc.
o Number of bedrooms,
o Number of bathrooms
o Furnished/unfurnished
o City quadrant: SW, NW, NE, SE

regular renters, will have the privilege of being notified, when new listings is posted that matches their
search criteria. Also, they should be to unsubscribe at any time.

retrieve properties, and registered customers, and landlord.
• RQ8: Mangers should be able to ask for a periodical summary report that shows:
o Total number of houses listed in the period. Notice that some houses that are listed may not be
active anymore. It means some houses their posting period can be expired or landlords have
cancelled their posting, therefore the renters cannot view them anymore.
o Total number of houses rented in the period
